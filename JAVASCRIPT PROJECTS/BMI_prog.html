<!-- Problem statement
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is the ratio of the weight of a person(in kilograms) to the square of the height(in meters)

Formula To Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI)

BMI = weight / (height x height);
Write a JavaScript program that calculates the BMI, and reports the BMI category as per the following table:

BMI Category	BMI
Underweight	below 18.5
Healthy	18.6 to 24.9
Overweight	25 to 25.9
Obese	Obese 30 or greater
Input Data

Weight 58kg and height 1.60m
Expected Output

Your Body Mass Index is: 22.656249999999996 and
You are Healthy. -->
